          * After quality control of the raw data, there are many tools installed in Galaxy for further data analysis.

          * See the tabs above for common analyses, which include suggested tools and workflows.       

          * Analysis type will depend on the sequencing datatype (e.g. DNA or RNA, short-read or long-read) and your research aims.

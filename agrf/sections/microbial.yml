          PacBio HiFi full-length 16S data is quality filtered and denoised to high quality amplicon single variants (ASVs) using QIIME2 and DADA2. ASV classification is performed using two approaches. We perform a consensus alignment classification (using VSEARCH) against the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r207). This approach should give high consistency. We also perform naïve Bayesian machine learning based classification (DADA2) using three databases that successively fall over to the next one if a species level match is not found. In order, they are the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r207), the SILVA rRNA database (v138), and the NCBI RefSeq 16S rRNA database supplemented by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). This should give better classification for low abundance ASVs

        description_md: |      
         **Read length:**  ~1500 bp - Full-length reads are defined as reads with both F27 and R1492 primers

         **Number of Reads:** Typically greater than 50K reads per sample.

         Read output varies depending on the composition and quality of the sample. Analyses provided by AGRF capps reads at 50K/sample. All reads captured during sequencing are available in the FASTQ files. Reviewing the rarefaction curves can provide insight to whether running an analysis with uncapped reads will provide more information or not.

               QIIME 2 produces two main file types. `.qza` and `.qzv`. Both are effectively zip files, but have different functions.

               * QIIME 2 Artifact files (.qza) - Data containers used to store raw or processed data, along with metadata and provenance (a complete record of how the data was created). A .qza file might contain:

                 * Raw or demultiplexed sequences: SampleData[SequencesWithQuality]
                 * Feature tables: FeatureTable[Frequency]
                 * Phylogenetic trees: Phylogeny[Rooted]
                 * Taxonomy assignments: FeatureData[Taxonomy]
                 * Diversity metrics: AlphaDiversity, DistanceMatrix
                 <br>

               * QIIME 2 Visualisation files (qzv) - Interactive reports that display data summaries, plots, and analysis results in a human-readable format. A .qzv file might contain:
               
                 * Quality plots of sequence reads
                 * Taxonomy bar plots
                 * Alpha/beta diversity significance tests
                 * Heatmaps, PCoA plots, boxplots, etc.

                Alpha diversity measures the diversity *within* a single sample. There are a number of different metrics used. AGRF's analysis includes four alpha diversity metrics (stored within separate .qza files).

                 - `observed_features_vector.qza` - Sample richness per sample. A count of the number of features (i.e. species) observed per sample.
                 - `shannon_vector.qza` - Shannon entropy (i.e. Shannon index) for each sample. This is a quantitative measure of community richness (number of species present) and evenness. Specifically, it quantifies the uncertainty in predicting the species of an individual microbe (or effectively a read) taken at random from the sample.          
                 - `evenness_vector.qza` - Pielous evenness index for each sample. A measure of how close in numbers (sequence counts) each species in a sample is. It is the ratio of the Shannon index to the maximum possible Shannon index if every species was equally likely. Value between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the more even.         
                 - `faith_pd_vector.qza` - Faiths phylogenetic distance. A phylogenetically aware alpha diversity metric. Equal to the sum of all branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree that spans all members of the sample. The higher the number the greater the diversity.

                Each .qza file contains alpha-diversity.tsv which can be extracted in Galaxy using the `qiime tools export` tool. The .tsv contains two columns: [<i><small>sample name.fastq</small></i>] , [<i><small>alpha diversity metric</small></i>]

                * Shannon Index (richness + evenness)

               description_md: |
                QIIME 2 repeatedly subsamples (rarefies) each sample’s sequence data at different depths (e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000 reads, etc.). 
                For each depth, it calculates an alpha diversity metric (e.g., Shannon index, Faith's PD).
                It does this multiple times per depth to account for random variation (controlled by the --p-iterations parameter).
                The result is a curve for each sample showing diversity vs. sampling effort.

                Beta diversity measures the diversity *between* samples. There are a number of different metrics used. AGRF's analysis includes four beta diversity metrics (stored within separate .qza files).

                 - `observed_features_vector.qza` - Sample richness per sample. A count of the number of features (i.e. species) observed per sample.
                 - `shannon_vector.qza` - Shannon entropy (i.e. Shannon index) for each sample. This is a quantitative measure of community richness (number of species present) and evenness. Specifically, it quantifies the uncertainty in predicting the species of an individual microbe (or effectively a read) taken at random from the sample.          
                 - `evenness_vector.qza` - Pielous evenness index for each sample. A measure of how close in numbers (sequence counts) each species in a sample is. It is the ratio of the Shannon index to the maximum possible Shannon index if every species was equally likely. Value between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the more even.         
                 - `faith_pd_vector.qza` - Faiths phylogenetic distance. A phylogenetically aware alpha diversity metric. Equal to the sum of all branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree that spans all members of the sample. The higher the number the greater the diversity.

                Each .qza file contains alpha-diversity.tsv which can be extracted in Galaxy using the `qiime tools export' tool. The .tsv contains two columns: `[sample name.fastq]` , `[alpha diversity metric]`

            
               inputs:

               description_md: |
                Non-phylogenetic beta diversity metrics provide a general overview of diversity based on counts or proportions. Common examples (included in AGRF's analysis) are: 

                * Observed features (richness)
                * Shannon Index (richness + evenness)
                * Pielou's Evenness (how equally distributed species are)

                Use this tool to calculate other non-phylogenetic beta diversity metrics.

               description_md: |
                Phylogenetic beta diversity metrics are useful when evolutionary distinctivness is relevant to your hypothesis (e.g., comparing ecosystems or communities with potentially different evolutionary histories). A common example (included om AGRF's analysis) is:
                
                * Faith's Phylogenetic Distance

                Use this tool to calculate other phylogenetic beta diversity metrics.

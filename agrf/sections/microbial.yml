          PacBio HiFi full-length 16S data is quality filtered and denoised to high quality amplicon single variants (ASVs) using QIIME2 and DADA2. ASV classification is performed using two approaches. We perform a consensus alignment classification (using VSEARCH) against the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r207). This approach should give high consistency. We also perform naïve Bayesian machine learning based classification (DADA2) using three databases that successively fall over to the next one if a species level match is not found. In order, they are the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB r207), the SILVA rRNA database (v138), and the NCBI RefSeq 16S rRNA database supplemented by the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). This should give better classification for low abundance ASVs

         QIIME2 artifact files are a self contained version control package that stores data (e.g., sequences, feature tables, trees) produced or consumed by QIIME 2 plugins. These are just zip files and can be opened by any compression software, however qiime tools export can be useful to convert to other formats.

    #  Alpha diversity is a measure of species richness and/or evenness within one sample.

      - title_md: <code>qiime2 diversity alpha</code> - Calculate alpha diversity
        description_md: |
          There are many metrics used to expressed alpha. Some common ones are:

          - `Observed_features` (richness)
          - `Shannon` Index (richness + evenness)
          - `pielou_e` Pielous Evenness (how equally distributed species are)

          Use this tool if you need to recalculate alpha diversity or want calculate a different alpha diversity metric from a feature table.  Feature tables are typically contained within certain `.qza` files.
